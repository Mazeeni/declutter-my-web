# Declutter My Web

A firefox addon for clearing web pages of unnecessary content, while allowing you to quickly toggle this content back on if you need it.

## What it can do:

- Blacklist distracting UI elements
- Save elements to different profiles, and enable these profiles from the addon popup.
- Automatically enable profiles by supplying a URL to match.
- Apply several profiles together so you can quickly show and hide only certain groups of elements.
- Easy right click menu to add element to blacklist.
- Blacklist element using HTML class names, so other elements of a similar type will also be blacklisted.
- Element highlighting system to simpify blocking elements, especially for the non tech savy.
