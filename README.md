# declutter-my-web
A firefox addon for clearing your browsing life. 

Blacklist distracting UI elements from your most-browsed websites such as embedded videos, popups, and links. Save elements to site-specific profiles, making it easy to group elements and switch the declutter mode on. 

## Features:
- Profile system so you can save and customise what collection of elements you want gone at the same time.
- Easy right click menu to add element to blacklist. 
- Blacklist element using HTML class names, so other elements of a similar type will also be blacklisted.
- Element highlighting system to simpify blocking elements, especially for the less-tech savy.
- Automatically turn on reading mode for matching pages.
